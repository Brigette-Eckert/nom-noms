# Nom Noms Recipe Site

# Notes:
  Be sure to include some example content for each content type. Make it meaningful content - your client doesn't want to see a bunch of gibberish. Your content should explain to your client what the function of each custom content type is and when they should use them for adding their own content. Your client will want to know, when should I create articles? When should I add basic pages? What are these Coffee Imports for?
  We will spend more time learning about theming later, make sure to focus more on content than appearance at first. But to change the styling on your site and modify an existing theme, use the CSS Injector module. Here is an excellent tutorial on how to use it. There's also the Sweaver module, and feel free to research other modules which allow you to customize themes.
